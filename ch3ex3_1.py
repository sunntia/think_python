#Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.
# >>> right_justify('monty')
#                                                       monty
#Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('monty') is 5.
def right_justify(s):
    r = (70 - len(s))
    print(' ' * r, s)
